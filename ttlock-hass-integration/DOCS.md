## How to Use

1. **Install Add-on**: Install the add-on from your supervisor panel (building the Docker image might take a few minutes on slower hardware).
2. **Set up Bluetooth**: 
   - Connect a compatible Bluetooth USB dongle to your Home Assistant device (recommended for the best range and stability).
   - In the **Configuration** tab, set the `bluetooth_adapter` option to match your adapter (usually `hci0` or `hci1`).
3. **Configure MQTT**: Make sure you have an MQTT broker installed and configured in Home Assistant (such as Mosquitto broker).
4. **Wake up the lock**: Press any key on your lock's keypad so it lights up and starts broadcasting BLE signals.
5. **Open Web UI & Pair**: Open the Ingress Web UI from the sidebar or the add-on page, and click the bold **Scan for Locks** button in the setup assistant to find and pair your lock.

## Configuration Settings

You can customize the add-on behavior under the **Configuration** tab in the Home Assistant UI:

```yaml
bluetooth_adapter: "hci0" # The Bluetooth device ID to use (e.g. hci0, hci1, 0, or 1)
ignore_crc: false # Set to true to ignore bad CRC checksums from older TTLock models
debug_communication: false # Set to true to log detailed raw BLE traffic for debugging
debug_mqtt: false # Set to true to log MQTT discovery and state messages
```

## Known Issues

- **Low BLE Signal**: Low BLE signals can lead to failed pairing attempts or missing/corrupted log syncs. Keep your Home Assistant Bluetooth dongle as close to the lock as possible.
- **Keypad Awake requirement**: The lock is offline and enters deep sleep when idle. It *must* be awake (keypad lit up) when attempting pairing, scans, or initial settings updates.
